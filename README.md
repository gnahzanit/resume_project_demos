## Scalar Art Application: Software Design
Onionshop is a drawing program that has a canvas which takes mouse or tablet input and outputs line strokes (drawing). Drawings can be saved to files with the extension .onion, and reopened later to continue editing.

### Contributions
* Implemented backend of the Shape tool, the ToolStateManager, the Tool interface, and the Brush and Pen class that make up the entirety of a functioning tool management system following Clean Architecture and the SOLID design principles.
* Designed the shapes drawing algorithm and integrated it to the frontend.
* Reviewed and closed more than 60 pull requests to ensure timely project workflow.
* Established working test structure necessary for future quality assurance and code correctness process for all Java Gradle unit test implementations.

## Sprout, Women in STEM Design Project for The Design of Interactive Computational Media
The Sprout project is created with recognition how 34% of STEM bachelorâ€™s degree holders are women, yet they only make up 23% of Canadians working in science and technology. With that the STEM field becomes one that is highly-male dominated, with unsupportive, exclusionary, and isolating work environment to women and especially women of colour. As a result, women who enter these spaces are more likely to experience work place difficulties with little support, which may lead to their withdrawal from the STEM pursuit.

Our team recognized the importance of creating spaces for women to form personal connections and receive mentor & mentee guidance, and how they can be significant in instilling confidence in women who wish to pursue STEM careers. Therefore, Spourt is created as an user centered design prototype in attempt to address these unique problems with the women in STEM experience.

## Wikipedia Article Network: Computer Science Foundation 

### Contributions
* Problem solved internet discontinuity issue during 40GB of data parsing by making process resume-able thereby completing the information stage of the project a week before the milestone deadline.
* Implemented and designed python based breadth-first search, html parsing, weighted/unweighted wikigraph, and miscellaneous testing/write-up that made up the entirety of the project backend which allowed for successful project execution and overall project workflow.
* Created the text file output portion of the frontend using appropriate backend data which made available a second downloadable option when interacting with the project result.
* Contributed to the write-up, specifically introduction and discussion.

## Climate Change Twitter Map: Computer Science Foundation

### Contributions
* Addressed and resolved back-end reset complications of twarc by making the data filtering process resume-able which lead the project to be able to meet all deadlines despite various internet issues.
* Designed and implemented interactive dash web page to display desired maps using back-end data animated by time, which resulted in an extremely presentable front-end that let the users pin-point the desired research result for the project.
* Contributed to the debugging and data filtering process, and the final write up.
